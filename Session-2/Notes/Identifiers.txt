Points about a Java Program:
----------------------------

1) Case Sensitivity - A Java program is case sensitive which means identifier "name" and "Name" are two.

2) Naming Convension for Class Names - the first letter of each word in the class name should be capital letter. 

Example:
    class MyFirstJavaClass{    }

    class PersonalDetails{     }

3) Naming convension for Method Names and Variable Names
- all method names and variable names should start with a lower case letter and there after each inner word's first letter should be capital letter.

Example:
 public void myMethodName() { }
 public void depositAmount() {}

 String firstName;

Java Identifiers:
-----------------
- names used in a Java Program is known as identifier.
- names used for classes, variables,  methods etc are called identifiers.

Identifier Rules
----------------
1) An identifier can have alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscore (_)  and $ symbol

2) An identifier should begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_); not with a number

3) A key word of java should not be used as an identifier.

4) Identifiers are case sensitive.  

5) No space is allowed between the characters of an identifierd

Examples:
firstName
last_name
